# BlazorNestedSupplyFromQueryIssue

The code provided is a simple reproduction of an issue I encountered in Blazor with SupplyFromQueryParameter.

The issue occurs when a component with containing a property marked with the SupplyParamaterFromQuery (CompOne) is then placed inside a component that also contains a property marked with SupplyParameterFromQuery (MainComp).
